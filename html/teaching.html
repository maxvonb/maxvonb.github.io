<h3> Teaching activities </h3>


<p style="text-align:justify">
    I am passionate about communicating scientific concepts and fostering a deeper
    understanding of biology among students.
    Especially, I enjoy teaching quantitative and computational methods to biology
    students, helping them to develop skills that are increasingly important in modern
    biological research.
